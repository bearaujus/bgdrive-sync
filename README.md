# BGDrive-Sync

During this extended holiday, I aimed to further enhance my skills, giving birth to this repository. It has just been
created, currently in a chaotic and unstructured state, as I am currently applying the "make it happen" concept. The
refinement or "make it better" phase may come at a later time.

In terms of potential, this repository holds significant promise for implementation across a wide range of use cases. I
hope you find it useful.

# Usage

As for now, your target directory to replicate needs one level below the binary. Example:

```
/bgdrive-sync (binary)
/config.yaml (config will be always one level with the binary)
-> /xxxx (your target path, see config.yaml)
```

So you need to run `make build` then simply copy your target folder inside the `/bin`. Now you can execute `make run`.

# TODO

- REFACTOR THIS REPO (:
